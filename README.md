Cell titer glow assay,Enhanced reproducibility


This is an automated toolkit for linear and non-linear regression curve analysis for Cell Titre Glow (CTG) assay. 

Cell titer glow assay is a common method used to measure the number of viable cells in a sample. The assay relies on the fact that viable cells emit light when exposed to a certain wavelength of light. By automating the analysis of regression curves, it saved time and effort for the scientists. It also provided more accurate and reproducible results than manual analysis. Some of the benefits of using this software for linear and non-linear regression curve analysis for cell titer glow assay:
- Increased efficiency: Automatically analyze multiple samples, which can significantly reduce the amount of time required to complete the assay.
- Improved accuracy: Can use more sophisticated regression algorithms than manual analysis, which can lead to more accurate results.
 -Enhanced reproducibility: Can ensure that all samples are analyzed using the same methods, which can improve the reproducibility of results.
